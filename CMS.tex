\section{Motivation.}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Motivation}

Particle physics experiments can be made studying cosmic rays, solar neutrinos, dark matter in galaxies, etc. 

\begin{exampleblock}{But don't forget accelerators... }
This experiments are the most popular because we can control almost all the initial conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The particles involved.
\item The energy of the beams.
\item The geometry of the experiment
\item The amount of particles. 
\end{itemize}    
\end{exampleblock}

Experimental particle physicists must know and understand how experiments works in order to know:
\begin{itemize}
\item What to look for.
\item And how to.
\end{itemize}

\section{First LHC.}

% HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

\begin{frame}[fragile]{LHC.}
Is the main accelerator managed by CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). 
21 member states-113 participant countries.

It`s the biggest particle collider on Earth:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 27 km circunference.
	\item 14 TeV at the center of mass. (8 TeV reached at Run 1)
	\item 100 m under the ground.
	\item 4 main experiments (detectors): ALICE,CMS,ATLAS,LHCb
\end{itemize}
The two principal parts are the injector chain and the main ring.
\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=10cm]{2}
\end{frame}

% HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The injector chain.}
Before reaching main ring, protons pass by a series of stages:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Extracted via ionization of Hydrogen in the Duoplasmatron Proton Ion Source.
		\item Accelerated at 50 MeV in Linac2 (1978).
		\item  Linac2 injects protons in the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB)
		and are accelerated up to 1.4 GeV.
		\item From PSB, protons are delivered to the Proton Synchrotron (PS) where
		they reach 28 GeV. They are also split from 6 initial bunches to 72, spaced by 25 ns.
		\item  Finally, the pre-acceleration chain is finished by the SPS, the Super Proton Synchrotron. There, the bunches are accelerated up to 450 GeV.
	\end{itemize}
	\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=10cm]{2}
\end{frame}

% HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

\begin{frame}[fragile]{LHC main ring.}
	It's composed of two rings that accelerate the proton bunches in opposite directions. Some characteristics of the design are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 15m magnets with an strong magnetic field of 8,33T. 
		\item Superconductivity involved (1.9 K).
		\item Ultra high vacuum of $10^{-9}$mbar.
		\item In addition LHC has other magnets to correct different characteristics of the beams: 520 quadrupoles, 2464 sextupoles, 1232 octupoles.
	\end{itemize}

% HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

\begin{frame}[fragile]{LHC main ring.}
	In collider experiments the main character is Luminosity:
\begin{equation}
\nonumber L=\frac{k_nN_{b}^{2}f_{rev}}{4\pi\sigma_x \sigma_y}R
\end{equation}
In LHC design, this parameters have the following values:	
	\begin{table}[]

		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	Cross section of a proton-proton collision at 14 TeV is 100-110 mb, 3 different processes are involved:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Elastic scattering: Protons exchange momenta but their structure remains unchanged.
		\item Diffractive scattering: Momenta exchange but additional particles are generated apart from the final protons.
		\item Inelastic scattering: Partons interchange a big amount of momentum and produce several particles.
		
	\end{itemize}

	The CMS ECAL system was designed to stop photons and electrons and measure their energy, it is a cylindrical hermetic calorimeter made of 61200 crystals in the barrel and 7324 in the endcap.\\
	The crystal material is lead tungstate and was chosen for its short radiation depth, high density and fast emitting scintillation (25 ns). Its main disadventage is its highly dependent response to temperature. (2\%/C)
	\\
	This systems need constant correction because it loss of transparency due to radiation, the crystals aging is calibrated by a laser system.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Hadronic Calorimeter.}
	The CMS HCAL is the subsystem made for hadron detection, its subdivided as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hadron Barrel Calorimeter (HB): Covering $|\eta| < 1.4$ is located between the	ECAL barrel and the magnet.
		\item Hadron Endcap Calorimeter (HE): Extends the coverage of the barrel in the
		region $1.4 <|\eta| < 3$.
		\item Hadron Outer Calorimeter (HO): Located outside the magnet.
		\item Hadron Forward Calorimeter (HF): Completes the coverage of the system
		from $|\eta| = 3$ up to $|\eta| = 5.2$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\includegraphics[width=9cm]{15}

% HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Hadronic Calorimeter.}
	The system is made of two parts: absorbers to develop hadronic showers and scintillators to measure particles energy. 
	\\
	The HB absorber	is made of 40 mm thick steel plate, 8 layers of brass plates of 50.5 mm , 6 brass plates of 56.5 mm and a steel plate of 75 mm . The HE	uses the same absorber but with thicker plates of 79 mm. Between the absorber	plates a plastic scintillator, Kuraray SCSN81, 3.7 mm thick, is placed.
	\\
	\metroset{block=fill}
	\begin{exampleblock}{}
		The produced light in the HB is collected by optical fibers and
		transferred to the Hybrid Photo Diodes (HPDs). These diodes were chosen because
		of their small sensitivity to the magnetic field, an important feature because HCAL
		is inside the solenoid magnet.
		
	\end{exampleblock}
	
	\metroset{block=fill}
	\begin{exampleblock}{High radiation problem at HF}
		The HF design is different from the rest of the HCAL . The most
		important challengeis the high resistance to radiation from collisions:
		while in the central rapidity region, 100 GeV are deposited in average, in the
		forward region, is 760 GeV. For this reason a Cherenkov detector made of quartz fibers with a steel absorber was chosen. The light produced in the
		HF is collected by photo multipliers.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Muon Chambers.}
	The muon detector systems is located at the most exterior layer of the dectector due to the high prenetration power of muons. The cambers are made of three subsystems:
	

		\begin{itemize}
			\item  Drift Tubes Chambers (DT): located in the region with $ |\eta|< 1.2$ and disposed in four layers. They consist of individual drift tubes of 50 $\mu$m of diameter anode wire with two electrode plates creating a drift electric field.
			The wall of the cell act as cathode. The cells are filled with a gas mixture,
			85\% Argon and 15\% CO2 .
			
						
			\item  Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC): installed in the endcaps, provide a coverage up to $|\eta| = 2.4$ from $|\eta| = 0.9$. These chambers are multi-wire proportional chambers made of six planes of anode wires with 7 cathode planes with a gas in the middle and perpendicular to each other. This system is able to measure with a precision between the 75 $\mu$m and 150 $\mu$m.
			\item  Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC): This subsystem is made of gaseous parallel plate detectors. This detector is specially useful for triggering as it is very fast and have a good position resolution. There are 480 RPC distributed in	6 layers in the barrel with the DT and in 3 layers in the endcaps with the CSC, and covers the region with$|\eta|  < 1.6$.
